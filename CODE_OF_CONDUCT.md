## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Deletion

This sounds nicer than it does, trust me. We will delete any of your evil comments
and things so that people don't see it.

### 2. Warning

If you are starting to become evil then we give you a warning to not be evil
and we want you to not ignore it, we want you to read it and make sure you wont
do that stuff.

### 3. Temporary ban
If you are evil but you just not that evil then we give you a temporary ban. This will
just ban you for a short amount of time. Think of this as a warning but a little
more extreme

### 4. Perma ban (aka the boot)

If you are just too evil to everyone and decide to be a menace to this society we
are going to have to give you **THE BOOT!!!** And you will no longer be able to be part
of the community!!!

**USE COMMON SENSE, LEADERS HAVE THE RIGHT TO BAN PEOPLE WITH DESCRETION**
